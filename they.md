Yep, there's more than one of us in this brain! This is really hard for us to put into words, so I highly reccomend reading <a href="https://freyasspirit.com/plurality-playbook/" class="uno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Google's Plurality Playbook</a> for context on understanding dissociative disorders, as well as plurality as a whole. Instead of assigning names to this system, we'll try to identify ourselves w/ emoji wherever feasible:

- —✨, the communicator and vessel (plural they/them)
- —🧙‍♀️, the magical nerd, v passionate (she/her)
- —🦊, the skilled vixen, wants fluffy tail (vi/vim)
- —🐙, the slightly horny gal (she/her)
- —🌵, the foodie, decision maker, non-verbal (they/them)

I go into a bit more detail in this <a href="https://twitter.com/pixelyunicorn/status/1095153748354117632" class="uno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Twitter thread</a>. (I will still mostly refer to myself using "I", however "we" will be used in contexts in appropriate.)
